# Counters App

Welcome to the Counters App repository. This web application is designed to provide a simple and interactive counter management experience. This README serves as a guide on how to use and run the app.

## Introduction

The Counters App is a straightforward yet educational tool for understanding the basics of React, including components, state management, and event handling.
## Key Concepts
This project provides an opportunity to learn or reinforce your understanding of the following React concepts:

Components: React applications are built using components, which are self-contained, reusable pieces of UI. In this project, you'll find the Counter and App components.

State: React components can have state, which represents data that can change over time. The counter value in this app is managed using component state.

Event Handling: React allows you to define and handle events, such as clicking a button. In this project, you'll see how to handle events like incrementing and decrementing the counter value.

### Features

- Increment the counter value by 1.
- Decrement the counter value by 1.
- Gain a fundamental understanding of React components and state management.
- Learn how to handle events in React applications.
